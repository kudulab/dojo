### 0.13.1 (2024-Dec-29)

* docker-compose: support it when there is no version statement in the top of the yaml file; tested with docker-compose v2.24.5 and v2.31.0
* docker-compose: fix json decoding on mac - the Publishers field was resulting in decoding errors
* bump dojo image scripts base images
  * alpine:3.21
  * ubuntu:24.10

### 0.13.0 (2024-Feb-05)

* Support multiple levels of log output produced by Dojo: `silent`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`
* Preserve log output setting into the docker containers too, to configure how much output is visible from the dojo image scripts. (You'll need to rebuild your images for this to take effect)

### 0.12.1 (2024-Feb-05)

* Fix https://github.com/kudulab/dojo/issues/37 - support the case when the current directory contains special characters

### 0.12.0 (2024-Feb-04)

* Compile Dojo using Golang 1.21.6 thanks to using Docker image kudulab/golang-dojo:2.1.0
* Improve support for Docker-compose >2.
  * New versions of Docker-compose (e.g. 2.24.5) have different output of the `docker-compose ps` command (than the old versions of Docker-compose, e.g. 1.23.2). This was affecting Dojo as in Dojo was not aware that the containers were already created and running. This, in turn, was affecting the logging collection (the `--print-logs` options).
  * Also, the default docker containers in Docker-compose >2 contain this string `-default-` (with dashes), while the older versions of Docker-compose contained this string `_default_` (with underscores)
* Fix https://github.com/kudulab/dojo/issues/35 - support the case when the current directory contains upper case letters and Docker-Compose >2 is run

### 0.11.0 (2022-Feb-27)

* Compile Dojo using Golang 1.17.7 thanks to using Docker image kudulab/golang-dojo:2.0.0

### 0.10.5 (2022-Feb-20)

* Update a log message in entrypoint about sourcing the scripts

### 0.10.4 (2022-Feb-13)

* Fix issue #31. When using Colima instead of Docker Desktop or instead of running Docker on Linux, the output of `docker-compose ps` command is different. Without this fix, Dojo panics with `slice bounds out of range` in this line: https://github.com/kudulab/dojo/blob/0.10.3/docker_compose_driver.go#L633

### 0.10.3 (2020-Dec-07)

* Add workaround for issue #27. Instead of exiting with error, ignore the error with particular message and print a log message.

### 0.10.2 (2020-Oct-25)

* Fix image scripts - invalid permissions when running on Mac with FUSE volume driver \#21

### 0.10.1 (2020-Oct-25)

* Verify if Bash is installed when running Dojo. Dojo performs a shell out and Bash is its dependency. If Bash is not installed, a pretty error will be printed. [#22](https://github.com/kudulab/dojo/issues/22)
* Use newer pytest version 6.1.1, was 4.4.1
* Improve e2e tests output - print stdout and stderr on failure
* Improve e2e tests when checking for warn or error strings

### 0.10.0 (2020-Sep-06)

* Added support for [homebrew on Linux](https://github.com/kudulab/dojo/pull/20). Thanks to [Justin Garrison](https://github.com/rothgar)

### 0.9.0 (2020-Aug-13)

* support exported bash functions [#17](https://github.com/kudulab/dojo/issues/17).
   Earlier, Dojo resulted in an error when any bash function was exported. Now,
   it will succeed. However, in order to preserve all the exported bash functions, you
   need to run:
   ```
   source /etc/dojo.d/variables/01-bash-functions.sh
   ```

### 0.8.0 (2020-Jan-01)

* Docker-composer driver: enable printing logs of non default docker containers either to console or to file.
 Previously, only printing on console (stderr) was supported. This can be set by `--print-logs-target`
 commandline option and by `DOJO_DOCKER_COMPOSE_PRINT_LOGS_TARGET` Dojofile option.
 Possible values: console, file. [#12](https://github.com/kudulab/dojo/issues/12)
* Fix automated github releases to add release notes and to not mark a release as pre-release

### 0.7.0 (2020-Jan-01)

Docker-compose driver: print logs of non default docker containers. By default this will be done if any
 of the containers (default or not) failed. This can be set by `--print-logs` commandline option
 and by `DOJO_DOCKER_COMPOSE_PRINT_LOGS` Dojofile option.
 Possible values: always, failure, never. [#12](https://github.com/kudulab/dojo/issues/12)

### 0.6.3 (2019-Sep-19)

Fix homebrew formula to handle upgrades

### 0.6.2 (2019-Sep-19)

Added homebrew tap automation

### 0.6.1 (2019-Sep-16)

Blacklist TMPDIR to improve OSX experience

### 0.6.0 (2019-Sep-13)

Added OSX support

### 0.5.0 (2019-May-03)

* support multi-line environment variables [#4](https://github.com/ai-traders/dojo/issues/4).
 From now on, we will pass into --env-file only these environment variables, which value is a single line.
 The variables which values are multi-line, are now saved to another file on docker host and mounted onto
 docker container(s) as /etc/dojo.d/variables/00-multiline-vars.sh. The entrypoint is expected to source
 all files in /etc/dojo.d/variables.
 In order to not deal with escaping quotes or special characters, the multi-line variables' values are
 serialized with base64. Example of a multi-line variable serialized in 00-multiline-vars.sh:
 ```
 export ABC=$(echo MTExCjIyMiAzMzM= | base64 -d)
 ```

### 0.4.3 (2019-May-01)

* fix: added script to image_scripts which always setups `/run/user/<ID>`;
 add tests
* image scripts: if olduid == newuid, do not run usermod or groupmod

### 0.4.2 (2019-Apr-30)

* use the same environment variables when running a `docker run` or `docker-compose run` command and
when generating the envFile

### 0.4.1 (2019-Apr-29)

* do not run chown dojo home dir when uid/gid matches

### 0.4.0 (2019-Apr-27)

* added e2e tests on alpine and ubuntu18, executed in `inception-dojo` image
* ported tests to pytest, dropped bats which does not work on alpine
* export `DOJO_WORK_*` variables for all started processes \#17391
* added script to image_scripts which always setups `/run/user/<ID>`

### 0.3.2 (2019-Apr-22)

* cross compile on Linux and Darwin
* add Darwin support for verification if shell is interactive, thanks to [#2](https://github.com/ai-traders/dojo/pull/2), [@Eiffel-Alpine](https://github.com/Eiffel-Alpine)
* from now on release two binaries: one for Linux amd64 and one for Darwin amd64

### 0.3.1 (2019-Feb-04)

* fix: while saving the environment variable: DISPLAY a new line was missing

### 0.3.0 (2019-Feb-04)

Change default behavior that preserved current environment (by the means of environment file) only to the default
container (driver: docker-compose). Now, by default we preserve to all the containers. Still the old behavior can
be set by:
```
dojo --preserve-env-to-all=false
```


### 0.2.1 (2019-Feb-01)

* fix: resolve relative paths in config object
* fix: allow docker and docker-compose run if WorkDirOuter or IdentityDirOuter does not exist
* make github release happen on CI

### 0.2.0 (2019-Jan-25)

* feature: support configurable exit behavior for docker-compose driver if a non-default container stops #17197
* fix: better react on signals, do not depend on how docker and docker-compose react

### 0.1.0 (2019-Jan-16)

Initial release. Features #17138:
   1. Support drivers: docker, docker-compose.
   1. Read configuration from CLI and configuration file. Default configuration file is `./Dojofile`. Dojofile is not a bash script, it will be not sourced.
   1. Support running without any configuration file.
   1. Support actions: `dojo -a run` (default) and `dojo -a pull`.
   1. Support forcing not interactive docker run and docker-compose run.
   1. Support not removing docker containers (only for driver: docker).
   1. Support blacklisting env variables. If any env variable is blacklisted, it will be kept with "DOJO_" prefix. A good default of blacklisted variables is set.
   1. Support graphical mode (opinionated right now). If environment variable `DISPLAY` is set, mount as docker volume: `/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix`.
   1. If Dojo is run as root, show a warning.
   1. If DOJO_WORK_OUTER is owned by root, show a warning.
   1. Support ctrl+c (SIGINT) and SIGTERM.
   1. Provide example Dojo docker image entrypoint, test it on Alpine and Ubuntu.
   1. Support easy to configure docker-compose files. Do not require end user to add lines like `${DOJO_IDENTITY}:/dojo/identity:ro`,
      Dojo handles that by generating another docker-compose file (`docker-compose.yml.dojo`).
      Thus, we need docker-compose >=1.7.1, because it added [multiple compose files support](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#multiple-compose-files)

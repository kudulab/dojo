# Dojo

A CLI tool to keep **environment as code**.

Dojo ensures that you have a versioned, well-defined, reproducible **environment to run your operations in**. What operations? These could be software lifecycle operations (e.g. code compilation, running unit tests) or other admin operations (e.g. creating backups, uploading files).

How does it work? Dojo locally orchestrates [Docker](https://docker.com) containers. Environment is defined by Docker images. Dojo adds a few standards for the Docker images and also takes care of creating and removing the containers.

The Dojo project consists of:
 * `dojo` - a golang executable (CLI), which leverages `docker` and `docker-compose`
 * A specification and helper scripts for building [Dojo Docker images](#docker-images)


## Operating Systems
* Dojo works on **Linux, Mac, and [Windows Subsystem for Linux
 (WSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux)**
* Dojo is continuously tested only on Linux

## Installation

### Dependencies
The following must be installed for Dojo to run:
* Bash
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) - you must be able to run a local Docker daemon that can execute Linux Docker containers
* [Docker-Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose) >=1.7.1 (only if using Dojo driver: docker-compose)

### The Dojo binary
There is only 1 binary file to install. Installation options (choose one):
* with homebrew:
```
brew install kudulab/homebrew-dojo-osx/dojo
```
* a manual install:
```sh
version="0.13.0"
# on Linux:
wget -O /tmp/dojo https://github.com/kudulab/dojo/releases/download/${version}/dojo_linux_amd64
# or on Mac:
wget -O /tmp/dojo https://github.com/kudulab/dojo/releases/download/${version}/dojo_darwin_amd64
chmod +x /tmp/dojo
sudo mv /tmp/dojo /usr/bin/dojo
```
* build the binary file yourself, see [Development](#development)

You may find out what is the latest Dojo version [here](https://github.com/kudulab/dojo/releases).

## Quickstart
First, follow the [instructions](#installation) to install Dojo. Dojo CLI will be available to use in this way:
```
dojo <flags> [--] <CMD>
```

### Java Example
Let's compile this [java project](https://github.com/tomzo/gocd-yaml-config-plugin) using dojo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomzo/gocd-yaml-config-plugin.git
cd gocd-yaml-config-plugin
dojo "gradle test jar"
```

The beginning of the output shows the docker command executed by Dojo:
```console
/tmp/gocd-yaml-config-plugin$ dojo "gradle test jar"
2020/12/09 07:40:28 [ 1]  INFO: (main.main) Dojo version 0.10.5
2020/12/09 07:40:28 [ 4]  INFO: (main.DockerDriver.HandleRun) docker command will be:
 docker run --rm -v /tmp/gocd-yaml-config-plugin:/dojo/work -v /home/tomzo:/dojo/identity:ro --env-file=/tmp/dojo-environment-dojo-gocd-yaml-config-plugin-2020-12-09_07-40-50-60121947 -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -ti --name=dojo-gocd-yaml-config-plugin-2020-12-09_07-40-50-60121947 kudulab/openjdk-dojo:1.4.1 "gradle test jar"
Unable to find image 'kudulab/openjdk-dojo:1.4.1' locally
1.4.1: Pulling from kudulab/openjdk-dojo
```
Then, there is the `docker pull` output. Then, the container is created  and the java tests are executed.
The build artifacts land in `build/libs/`, because that is how gradle behaves. These artifacts are available on our docker host.
Things to notice:
 * We have pulled [`kudulab/openjdk-dojo` docker image](https://github.com/kudulab/docker-openjdk-dojo) and created container from it.
 * Current directory `/tmp/gocd-yaml-config-plugin` was [mounted](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) to `/dojo/work`. This means that the same and only copy of our project files is available on the Docker host and in the container. If you create more containers with Dojo, `/dojo/work` will be also available there.
 * Home directory on host `/home/tomzo` was [mounted](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) as readonly to `/dojo/identity`
 * After `gradle test jar` has finished running non-interactively, the docker container has exited and was removed. This is because we provided a command to `dojo`.


#### Interactive mode
Dojo images are supposed to support 2 modes: an interactive mode and non-interactive mode. In order to run interactively, run `dojo` without any command:
```console
/tmp/gocd-yaml-config-plugin$ dojo
```

This allows us to work in the container for longer time, very much like in a [vagrant VM](#vs-vagrant). You will have to manually exit from the container.

### Golang Example
Let's build this project (Dojo) using `dojo`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kudulab/dojo.git
cd dojo
dojo -c Dojofile.build "./tasks _build" # or just ./tasks build
```

Here we used Dojo flag `-c Dojofile.build`. This way we instructed dojo CLI which Dojofile to use. Dojofile keeps information about the Docker Image. [Dojofile.build](https://github.com/kudulab/dojo/blob/master/Dojofile.build) uses [kudulab/golang-dojo](https://github.com/kudulab/docker-golang-dojo) Docker image.

### AWS Example

There are also Dojo Docker images which bundle a tool (or group of tools), e.g. awscli. Example usage:
```
$ nano Dojofile
$ cat Dojofile
DOJO_DOCKER_IMAGE="kudulab/aws-dojo:0.7.0"
$ dojo
# now we run interactively in the Dojo Docker container
dojo@407490ab35cb(aws-dojo):/dojo/work$ aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=ec2-ansible-test"
{
    "Reservations": []
}
```

To exit the container, type `exit`.

### Docker in Docker (dind) Example

There are 2 methods.

The first method is to **use the Docker Daemon from host**. E.g.:
```
$ cat Dojofile.docker-from-host
DOJO_DOCKER_IMAGE="kudulab/ansible-dojo:1.5.0"
# we use docker daemon from host
DOJO_DOCKER_OPTIONS="-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
```

```
$ dojo -c Dojofile.docker-from-host
# now we run in Docker container
$ sudo docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                        COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                     PORTS               NAMES
2a1529381f9f        kudulab/ansible-dojo:1.5.0   "/usr/bin/tini -g --â€¦"   7 seconds ago       Up 6 seconds                                   dojo-dojo-2020-12-18_08-19-32-69068479
```
The above command listed the Docker container, we are currently running in. The [docker-ansible-dojo](https://github.com/kudulab/docker-ansible-dojo) Dojo Docker image was used.

Using this method is not suitable to run Dojo in Dojo. But, you may want to use it:
  * when you want to provision a container on your host, and you want to invoke Ansible (or other provisioning tool) from another container on the same host,
  * when you want to build a Docker image on your host, and you want to invoke Packer (or other similar tool) from another container on the same host.

------

The second method is to **run a separate Docker Daemon inside of a Docker container**. We can use [docker-inception-dojo](https://github.com/kudulab/docker-inception-dojo) Dojo Docker image:
```
$ cat Dojofile.dind-ubuntu18
DOJO_DOCKER_IMAGE="kudulab/inception-dojo:ubuntu18-dind-0.2.1"
DOJO_DOCKER_OPTIONS="--privileged"
```

```
$ dojo -c Dojofile.dind-ubuntu18
# now we run in the Docker container
# no containers are running inside the current Docker container:
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
$ ps aux | grep docker
root         198  0.0  0.0    200     4 pts/0    S    07:59   0:00 s6-supervise docker

dojo         346  0.0  0.0  13212  1096 pts/0    S+   08:00   0:00 grep --color=auto docker
$ docker --version
Docker version 19.03.5, build 633a0ea838
$ docker info | grep "Server Version"
 Server Version: 19.03.5

$ docker run --rm alpine:3.15 whoami
Unable to find image 'alpine:3.15' locally
# pulling image messages

dojo@ebc220b9655f(inception-dojo):/dojo/work$ docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
alpine              3.9                 78a2ce922f86        7 months ago        5.55MB
```

There is also an Alpine dind Docker image. Use it in the following way:
```
$ cat Dojofile.dind-alpine
DOJO_DOCKER_IMAGE="kudulab/inception-dojo:alpine-dind-0.2.1"
DOJO_DOCKER_OPTIONS="--privileged"
```

This method is suitable for running Dojo in Dojo. Dojo e2e tests use this method to test various Docker commands in a clean, separate Docker container. This way, such tests cannot affect Docker containers or images on Docker host (they have a safe environment to run in).

### Public alpine image

You can use Dojo with any Docker image, it does not have to be a Dojo Docker image. Example with an alpine image:
```
$ nano Dojofile
$ cat Dojofile
DOJO_DOCKER_IMAGE="alpine:3.16"
$ dojo
# now we run interactively in the Dojo Docker container
/ # whoami
root
/ # pwd
/
/ # apk -h
apk-tools 2.12.9, compiled for x86_64.
/ # ls -la /dojo/work/
# Dojo mounts your current directory from your host (e.g. laptop) to /dojo/work inside a Docker container
total 348
drwxrwxr-x   12 1000     1000          4096 Apr 12 06:15 .
drwxr-xr-x    4 root     root            34 Apr 12 06:15 ..

# Dojo mounts your $HOME directory from your host (e.g. laptop) to /dojo/identity inside a Docker container
total 62752
drwxr-xr-x   73 1000     1000         12288 Apr 12 01:32 .
drwxr-xr-x    4 root     root            34 Apr 12 06:15 ..
drwxrwxr-x    3 1000     1000          4096 Jun 13  2022 .Azure
drwxrwxr-x   12 1000     1000          4096 Apr  3 23:05 .atom
drwxrwxr-x    2 1000     1000          4096 Oct  2  2021 .aws
```

To exit the container, type `exit`.

## Features

You can use Dojo with any Docker image, but some features are only supported with custom Dojo Docker images. Therefore running Dojo without a Dojo Docker image is not recommended.

| Feature | Works with custom Dojo Docker images | Works with any image |
| - | - | - |
| Dojofile | Yes | Yes |
| Starting, stopping, removing containers | Yes | Yes |
| Signals support | Yes | Yes |
| Support for running interactively and non-interactively | Yes | Yes |
| All drivers support (Docker, Docker-compose) | Yes | Yes |
| Preserving environment variables | Yes | Yes |
| Having the $HOME directory mounted as `/dojo/identity` in a Docker container | Yes | Yes |
| Having the current directory mounted as `/dojo/work` in a Docker container | Yes | Yes |
| Defaulting to `/dojo/work` as a start directory in a Docker container | Yes | No. A random image usually enters `/`. |
| Custom startup scripts for a container | Yes | No |
| Running as a custom user, not `root`. | Yes | No. Most images by default use root user inside the image, therefore any files created in the container will be owned by root. |
| Handling mismatch between UID/GID of the user on the host and UID/GID inside the container. It's for keeping artifacs and project files owned by the same user during the entire project lifecycle. | Yes | No. A random image usually runs as root, even if not, then still chances of UID/GID match with `/dojo/work` bind-mount are low. |

## Why was Dojo created? Dojo benefits

Docker and containerization has revolutionized application lifecycle by creating a common standard. Dojo uses Docker to provide a similar standard for environments, providing environments as code. Dojo allows environments to be versioned, released as a Docker image and used in the Infrastructure As Code manner.

Why was Dojo created? Dojo benefits:
* to **shorten setup time of development environment** to near-zero
* to **have environment parity** - environment consistent between multiple developers or between a developer and a CI server (fixes **works on my machine** problem)
* to **have easily reproducible environments** (if your environment changed and you experience configuration drift, you can just recreate a Dojo Docker container)
* to **treat environment as code** and lock it in source control of a project. The environment of a project is thus specified in one place, in [Dojofile](#dojofile)
* to **execute commands in docker** much more easily than with bare `docker run`. Dojo takes care of many little details. (See [lower why](#Why-not-just-docker-run))

Problems solved by Dojo and surrounding practices:
1. **Works on my machine** - with Dojo, each host (a developer's workstation or a CI agent) gets a **consistent, reproducible** environment delivered by a docker image.
1. **Configuration management** - with Dojo, any development environment is built from a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/), which is versioned and released as a docker image.  Therefore the provisioning of the environment is stated in several commands, providing both documentation and a setup script in the single source of truth.
1. Tools on CI agents or developer's laptop over time may mismatch with project's required setup - With Dojo the environment is pulled as docker image just before the operation to be executed, therefore **hosts don't need to be provisioned repeatedly to keep up with changing projects**.

## Who is it for?

1. **as-code practitioners** - If you like *as-code philosophy* (infrastructure-as-code, pipelines-as-code) then you'll like Dojo, which provides **development and operations environment as code**.
1. Consultants, DevOps Engineers, **anyone jumping between projects and languages often**. With Dojo, getting the *right environment* for a project takes as long as the `docker pull`.
1. **Polyglot software houses**, especially where CI agents are shared by a variety of projects.
1. If you are already running builds with docker, then Dojo will make your scripts shorter and your life easier.

By adopting Dojo you would be shifting responsibility for the development environment closer to the developers.
A dojo docker image becomes a contract of what is a **correct environment** for a project **at a particular commit** (see [Dojofile](#dojofile)).




# Dojo Docker images

A dojo docker image is responsible for providing the environment for running your operations.

You can find complete examples of [open source "dojo images" on github](https://github.com/topics/dojo-image). Or you can build your own image starting from minimal example [snippets below](#image-scripts).

### Image requirements and best practices
We have several **rules and recommendations** on how to properly craft a dojo docker image. Dojo also provides [common setup scripts](#image-scripts) to achieve most of it.
1. Image must have `dojo` user and group. We recommend to set uid and gid to `1000`, although it is not necessary.
1. Image must have `bash` and `sudo` installed.
1. On container start, image should change uid and gid of dojo user to match with owner of the `/dojo/work` mount. Then, if any files were owned by dojo, their permissions should be updated.
1. The [docker image entrypoint](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint):
    * must change current user to dojo user
    * should support running interactive and non-interactive shell
    * should source files in `/etc/dojo.d/variables/*`
    * should run files in `/etc/dojo.d/scripts/*`
    * should reap processes properly, by using an init system like [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini) or [s6](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay).
1. Image must ensure that current directory after starting container is `${dojo_work}` (by default `/dojo/work`).
1. Image shell prompt may include name of the dojo image being used. E.g. `dojo@297ea3cf20eb(openjdk-dojo):/dojo/work$`

We have also established several **best practices** for dojo image development:
 * Treat each dojo image as any software project with its own lifecycle. That implies: automate builds and releases, but most importantly **test the image before a release**.
 * Use semantic versioning for the docker image.
 * Leverage images available on dockerhub in the [`FROM` dockerfile instruction](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from), then provision your custom tools and dojo-specific scripts. E.g. start a [java-dojo](https://github.com/kudulab/docker-openjdk-dojo/blob/master/image/Dockerfile#L1) from the official `openjdk` image.
 * If the development environment requires [secrets setup](#secrets), then container should assert validity of the secrets on start and exit with non-zero status if anything is missing.

## Image scripts

Dojo provides [several scripts](image_scripts/src) to be used inside dojo images to meet most of above requirements. Scripts can be installed in a `Dockerfile` with:

```dockerfile
ENV DOJO_VERSION=0.10.5
RUN git clone --depth 1 -b ${DOJO_VERSION} https://github.com/kudulab/dojo.git /tmp/dojo_git &&\
  /tmp/dojo_git/image_scripts/src/install.sh && \
  rm -r /tmp/dojo_git
```
Above script takes care of:
 * `dojo` user setup
 * handling owner of `/dojo/work`
 * provisioning of a correct [entrypoint](image_scripts/src/entrypoint.sh)

Image developer is still responsible for:
 * installing bash and sudo
 * ensuring that current directory after starting container is `${dojo_work}` (by default `/dojo/work`).

Below are valid, minimal examples of dojo dockerfiles:
 - [debian and ubuntu](#typical-debian-dockerfile)
 - [alpine](#typical-alpine-dockerfile)

### Typical debian dockerfile

For debian-family systems (including ubuntu) a typical dockerfile has following structure:

```dockerfile
FROM debian:9

ENV TINI_VERSION v0.18.0
ADD https://github.com/krallin/tini/releases/download/${TINI_VERSION}/tini /tini
RUN chmod +x /tini

# Install common Dojo scripts
ENV DOJO_VERSION=0.10.5
RUN apt-get update && \
  DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
  sudo git ca-certificates && \
  git clone --depth 1 -b ${DOJO_VERSION} https://github.com/kudulab/dojo.git /tmp/dojo_git &&\
  /tmp/dojo_git/image_scripts/src/install.sh && \
  rm -r /tmp/dojo_git

#TODO: Add the tools your project needs

# Optional scripts to run on container start
#COPY etc_dojo.d/scripts/* /etc/dojo.d/scripts/
# Optional environment variables to source on container start
#COPY etc_dojo.d/variables/* /etc/dojo.d/variables/

COPY profile /home/dojo/.profile
COPY bashrc /home/dojo/.bashrc
RUN chown dojo:dojo /home/dojo/.profile /home/dojo/.bashrc

ENTRYPOINT ["/tini", "-g", "--", "/usr/bin/entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```

The supporting `bashrc` can be used to setup a command prompt:
```bash
PS1='\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\](minimal-debian-dojo):\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ '
```
And supporting `profile` can be used to ensure current directory is `${dojo_work}`:
```bash
# if running bash
if [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]; then
    # include .bashrc if it exists
    if [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then
      . "$HOME/.bashrc"
    fi
fi
# this variable is set by common Dojo image scripts
cd "${dojo_work}"
```

### Typical alpine dockerfile

For alpine images a typical dockerfile has following structure:

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.15

# Install common Dojo scripts
ENV DOJO_VERSION=0.10.5
RUN echo "http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/community" >> /etc/apk/repositories && \
  apk add --no-cache tini bash shadow sudo git && \
  git clone --depth 1 -b ${DOJO_VERSION} https://github.com/kudulab/dojo.git /tmp/dojo_git &&\
  /tmp/dojo_git/image_scripts/src/install.sh && \
  rm -r /tmp/dojo_git

#TODO: Add the tools your project needs

# Optional scripts to run on container start
#COPY etc_dojo.d/scripts/* /etc/dojo.d/scripts/
# Optional environment variables to source on container start
#COPY etc_dojo.d/variables/* /etc/dojo.d/variables/

COPY profile /home/dojo/.profile
COPY bashrc /home/dojo/.bashrc
RUN chown dojo:dojo /home/dojo/.profile /home/dojo/.bashrc

ENTRYPOINT ["/sbin/tini", "-g", "--", "/usr/bin/entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```

The supporting `bashrc` can be used to setup a command prompt:
```bash
PS1='\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\](minimal-alpine-dojo):\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ '
```
And supporting `profile` can be used to ensure current directory is `${dojo_work}`:
```bash
# if running bash
if [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]; then
    # include .bashrc if it exists
    if [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then
      . "$HOME/.bashrc"
    fi
fi
# this variable is set by common Dojo image scripts
cd "${dojo_work}"
```

## Secrets

Every organization manages secrets distribution differently. Dojo is agnostic towards the secret management. This section is an overview of several possibilities on how to deliver secrets into dojo containers.

#### Don't hardcode secrets in the image

I hope this is obvious.

#### Use environment variables

By default every `dojo` run will pass environment variables from the host to the container. So if you already have infrastructure in place which delivers secrets as environment variables, these secrets will just work inside dojo containers.

#### Copy secrets from home directory

Dojo [mounts current user's home into `/dojo/identity`](#home-and-identity-directory), one of the reasons is to allow the container startup scripts to copy secrets from the user's home. For example, ssh keys could be setup by adding a following script in the dojo image:
`/etc/dojo.d/scripts/10-setup-ssh.sh`
```bash
#/bin/bash -e
if [ ! -d "${dojo_identity}/.ssh" ]; then
  echo "${dojo_identity}/.ssh does not exist. This image requires ssh keys for operation"
  exit 5
else
  cp -r "${dojo_identity}/.ssh/" "${dojo_home}/"
  find ${dojo_home}/.ssh -name '*id_rsa' -exec chmod -c 0600 {} \;
  find ${dojo_home}/.ssh -name '*id_rsa' -exec chown dojo:dojo {} \;
fi
# we need to ensure that ${dojo_home}/.ssh/config contains at least:
# StrictHostKeyChecking no
echo "StrictHostKeyChecking no
UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
" > "${dojo_home}/.ssh/config"
```

#### Install secrets distribution tool in the image

All of your dojo images could include a tool such as [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), which would be used in the [image startup scripts](#image-scripts) to provision secrets locally in the container. This however, still requires to use any of the other methods to deliver `VAULT_TOKEN` used to authorize with the vault server to obtain other secrets.

#### Mount secrets as a volume

We don't recommend this, but it is an option. If the secret is outside the home directory of the user running `dojo`, then it can be mounted into the container by using [additional docker options](#docker-options):
```toml
DOJO_DOCKER_OPTIONS="-v /path/to/local/secret:/path/in/docker"
```

# Dojofile

`Dojofile` is a file specifying the docker image which should be used for current project.
In simplest form `Dojofile` contains only `DOJO_DOCKER_IMAGE` with a docker image reference:
```toml
DOJO_DOCKER_IMAGE="image_name[:tag]"
```
For example, a java project might have following `Dojofile`:
```toml
DOJO_DOCKER_IMAGE="kudulab/openjdk-dojo:1.4.1"
```

We recommend to:
 * add `Dojofile` at the root of the project
 * add `Dojofile` to the source control
 * use unambiguous docker tags, such as `kudulab/openjdk-dojo:1.4.1` rather than `kudulab/openjdk-dojo:latest`. This guarantees that current commit will be always built in the same image, which helps with reproducible builds.

### Dojofile options

`Dojofile` has several settings to control `dojo` behavior.

##### Dojo driver

```toml
DOJO_DRIVER="docker"
```
Defines which driver to use. Possible values are [docker](#docker-driver) or [docker-compose](#docker-compose-driver). Default is `docker`.

*equivalent CLI option is: `--driver`*

##### Image

```toml
DOJO_DOCKER_IMAGE="kudulab/dotnet-dojo:3.1.0"
```
Defines which image to use. The value must be a valid docker image reference, same as you would specify in `docker pull`. There is no default, you must specify an image in Dojofile or in CLI arguments.

*equivalent CLI option is: `--image`*

##### Docker options

```toml
DOJO_DOCKER_OPTIONS="-p 9090:80 --privileged"
```
Defines additional arguments for the `docker run` command. Default is empty.

*equivalent CLI option is: `--docker-options`*

##### Outer working directory

```toml
DOJO_WORK_OUTER="/tmp/my-project"
```
Defines directory on the docker host to mount into the container at `/dojo/work` (by default).
The default is to mount current working directory.

`Dojo` setups following mount `DOJO_WORK_OUTER:DOJO_WORK_INNER`.

*equivalent CLI option is: `--work-dir-outer`*

We do not recommend changing this.

##### Inner working directory

```toml
DOJO_WORK_INNER="/dojo/work/my-project"
```
Defines directory inside the docker container, which is mounted from the host. By default `/dojo/work`.

`Dojo` setups following mount `DOJO_WORK_OUTER:DOJO_WORK_INNER`.

*equivalent CLI option is: `--work-dir-inner`*

We do not recommend changing this.

##### Identity directory

```toml
DOJO_IDENTITY_OUTER="/home/joe"
```
Defines directory on the docker host to mount into the container at `/dojo/identity`.
The default is to mount current user's home. See more about [identity directory](#home-and-identity-directory).

`Dojo` setups following mount `DOJO_IDENTITY_OUTER:/dojo/identity`.

*equivalent CLI option is: `--identity-dir-outer`*

##### Blacklist variables

```toml
DOJO_BLACKLIST_VARIABLES="HOME,USER,MY_PREFIX_*"
```
By default dojo will pass environment variables from host to the container.
`DOJO_BLACKLIST_VARIABLES` can be used to control which variables should not be mapped.
It is a list of environment variables, split by commas, which should not be transfered from host to the docker container.
A blacklisted variable name can end with an asterisk, e.g. `BASH*`, which means that all the variables with BASH prefix (like `BASH_123`, `BASHBLA`) will be blacklisted.

The default value is:
```
"BASH*,HOME,USERNAME,USER,LOGNAME,PATH,TERM,SHELL,MAIL,SUDO_*,WINDOWID,SSH_*,SESSION_*,GEM_HOME,GEM_PATH,GEM_ROOT,HOSTNAME,HOSTTYPE,IFS,PPID,PWD,OLDPWD,LC*,TMPDIR"
```

*equivalent CLI option is: `--blacklist`*

##### Log level

```toml
DOJO_LOG_LEVEL="info"
```

* Available values: `silent`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`.
* If you want to minimise Dojo output, but still want to see the errors, set it to `error`.
* Defaults to `info`
* *In CLI use `--log-level=info`*. (There is also an obsolete CLI option `--debug=true` or `--debug=false`)
* If these (`--debug` and `--log-level`) are set to different values, then the most verbose value wins. E.g. if `DOJO_LOG_LEVEL="info"` and `--debug=true`, then the log level will be `debug`.


##### Docker-compose file

```toml
DOJO_DOCKER_COMPOSE_FILE="my-docker-compose.yaml"
```
Used only with [docker-compose driver](#docker-compose-driver), points to the docker-compose file which should be used for creating containers when running `docker-compose run`.
Default is `docker-compose.yml`.

*equivalent CLI option is: `-docker-compose-file`*

##### Docker-compose options

```toml
DOJO_DOCKER_COMPOSE_OPTIONS="--service-ports"
```
Defines additional arguments for the `docker-compose run` command. Used only with [docker-compose driver](#docker-compose-driver). Default is empty.

*no equivalent in CLI*

##### Docker-compose exit behavior

```toml
DOJO_EXIT_BEHAVIOR="abort"
```
Only applicable for [docker-compose driver](#docker-compose-driver).
Defines how to react when a non-default container exits. Possible values are:
 * `ignore` - the docker-compose run continues until default container exits.
 * `abort` (default) - the docker-compose run will be interrupted by dojo once any container stops.
 * `restart` - dojo will restart any non-default container which has stopped.

*equivalent CLI option is: `-exit-behavior`*

# Drivers

Dojo can run commands with [docker](#docker-driver) or [docker-compose](#docker-compose-driver), which is controlled by [`DOJO_DRIVER` option in dojofile](#dojo-driver).

## docker driver

`docker` driver is the default. It is based on `docker run` command and allows to create just one container for the development environment. It is useful for running builds, unit tests, simple CLI tools.

## docker-compose driver

`docker-compose` driver is based on `docker-compose run`. Several containers can be created to setup the development environment.
`Dojo` treats first container as the *default* (primary) container. It is the only container which has to be dojo-compliant. That means, you can use any other images in the remaining services.

Dojo with `docker-compose` driver is a very powerful tool. Some examples when it can be useful:
 * developing a java application which connects to a database. You can create `java-dojo` and linked `postgresql` container with a database server.
 * developing microservices, where default container is a dojo container where you develop an application, while several linked applications are containers with dependant microservices.
 * integration and performance testing. Especially with the `abort` [exit behavior](#docker-compose-exit-behavior), failure of any container will stop and fail the test.
 * Real-world example usage is [LiGet](https://github.com/ai-traders/LiGet), where we test nuget clients against a nuget server running in docker.

### docker-compose file

In order to use `docker-compose` driver, a Dojofile would include:
```toml
DOJO_DRIVER="docker-compose"
DOJO_DOCKER_IMAGE="kudulab/openjdk-dojo:1.4.1"
DOJO_DOCKER_COMPOSE_FILE="docker-compose.yml"
```

Next to the `Dojofile`, you must create a docker-compose.yml according the [official reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/).
Example docker-compose file:
```yaml
version: '2.2'
services:
  default:
    links:
      - db:db
  db:
    init: true
    image: postgres:11.2-alpine
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=my_pw
```

The docker-compose file must meet following several requirements to work with Dojo.
 * version of docker-compose file must be >=2.2
 * there must be a default service declared - it will be the container running a dojo docker image.
 * do not set `image` option in the default service. Because Dojo sets it based on `DOJO_DOCKER_IMAGE` from `Dojofile` or using CLI option.

You can try creating above 2 files in any directory and run `dojo`. The output should look like this:

```console

### Home and identity directory

By default Dojo mounts current user's home directory into `/dojo/identity`. The mount is read-only.
There are several reasons for such design:
 * `/dojo/identity` is read-only so hacking with the project inside container cannot break your home directory.
 * If user's home was mounted into `/home/dojo`, then many of the user's application settings could unintentionally break configuration of the dojo user in container. Instead every dojo image can selectively use `/dojo/identity` to setup `/home/dojo` so that container becomes operational.

### Handling signals
Dojo reacts on signals: SIGINT (Ctrl+C) and SIGTERM. Dojo recognizes if 1 or 2
signals were sent. This means: you can press e.g. Ctrl+C two times to speed up containers stopping.

| event | driver | Dojo behavior | exit status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| one signal | docker | docker stop that 1 container | 130 for SIGINT, 2 for SIGTERM |
| one signal | docker-compose | docker stop default container, then docker-compose stop to gracefully stop all the other containers | 130 for SIGINT, 2 for SIGTERM |
| 2 signals | docker | docker kill that 1 container | 3 |
| 2 signals | docker-compose | docker kill default container, then docker-compose kill to immediately stop all the other containers | 3 |
| >2 signals | all | ignored | 3 |


In order to not couple Dojo behavior with Docker and Docker-Compose behavior, signals from terminal are not simply preserved onto `docker run` or `docker-compose run` process (the process is started with a separate process group ID).


`docker-compose stop` and `docker-compose kill` do not stop the default container, created with `docker-compose run default CMD`,
thus, firstly, we stop the default container.


After goroutines that handle signals are finished, cleanup is performed (remove docker containers, network, environment file
and `docker-compose.yml.dojo` file).

To test reacting on signals, run the following commands. After "will sleep"
is printed, press Ctrl+C. You may also test pressing Ctrl+C more times.

1. driver: docker, container's PID 1 process **not** preserving signals:
```
dojo --image=alpine:3.15 -i=false sh -c "echo 'will sleep' && sleep 1d"
```
2. driver: docker, container's PID 1 process preserving signals:
```
dojo --docker-options="--init" --image=alpine:3.15 -i=false sh -c "echo 'will sleep' && sleep 1d"
```
3. driver: docker-compose:
```
dojo --driver=docker-compose --dcf=./test/test-files/itest-dc.yaml -i=false --image=alpine:3.15 sh -c "echo 'will sleep' && sleep 1d"
```

### Preserving exported Bash functions [#17](https://github.com/kudulab/dojo/issues/17)

*Needs Dojo >= 0.9.0*, earlier Dojo versions will result in an error like:
```
13-08-2020 19:53:43 Dojo entrypoint info: Sourcing: /etc/dojo.d/variables/00-multiline-vars.sh
/etc/dojo.d/variables/00-multiline-vars.sh: line 1: export: `DOJO_BASH_FUNC_my_bash_func%%=()': not a valid identifier
/etc/dojo.d/variables/00-multiline-vars.sh: line 1: export: `{': not a valid identifier
/etc/dojo.d/variables/00-multiline-vars.sh: line 1: export: `"hello"': not a valid identifier
/etc/dojo.d/variables/00-multiline-vars.sh: line 1: export: `}': not a valid identifier
```

---

You may want to have your **locally exported Bash functions available in a Dojo Docker image**. For example, you have defined and exported such a Bash function:
```
my_bash_func() {
  echo "hello"
}
export -f my_bash_func
```

This function (and all the other exported Bash functions) will be saved into the file `/etc/dojo.d/variables/01-bash-functions.sh` inside a Dojo Docker image. This is done automatically, by Dojo, on a container start. In order **to be able to invoke a function in a Dojo Docker image, you have to run**:
```
source /etc/dojo.d/variables/01-bash-functions.sh
```

If you use Dojo and Bats-core v1.2.1, use Dojo >= 0.9.0.

Due to using Sudo in Dojo images standard entrypoint, exported bash functions are not preserved and that is why you have to source the file yourself. Preserving Bash functions by Sudo was removed after Shellshock, see [this](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/549140/why-doesnt-sudo-e-preserve-the-function-environment-variables-exported-by-ex) and [this](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/233097).


# FAQ

### Will Dojo work with any docker image?

It will run, but this is not recommended. Please see [Features](#features).

### Why not just run `docker run`?

You may be using `docker run` or `docker-compose run` already for your builds. For example: `docker run -ti --volume $PWD:/build openjdk:8u212 gradle test`.
There are several issues which are not solved out of the box by these tools, in fact all of them are reasons why dojo was created:
 * Not running builds as root
 * Interactive vs non-interactive shell problems. E.g. you could not run `docker run -ti` on a CI agent, but you can on interactive terminal.
 * *Selectively* passing environment variables from host to the container.
 * Handling mismatch between UID/GID of the user on the host and UID/GID inside the container. Basically keeping artifacs and project files owned by the same user during the entire time.
 * In docker-compose dealing with containers crashed during the run
 * Capturing and handling signals.
 * Returning exit code from inside container to the host.
 * Cleanup of the containers and networks.
 * [Dojofile](#dojofile) enforces versioning of the reference to development environment.

### Multiple dojofiles

A single project can use multiple dojo images, therefore multiple `Dojofiles` should be checked-in the repository. For example, front-end and backend can live in same repository, written in 2 different languages.

We recommend to name your dojofiles with a suffix suggesting the type of environment. E.g. `Dojofile-nodejs` and `Dojofile-python`.
To point which `Dojofile` should be used, pass `-c` option to `dojo`:
```bash
dojo -c Dojofile-nodejs npm install
```

### How to fix `docker: invalid ip address: 7007`

It may happen that you run `dojo` and it fails with an error similar to `docker: invalid ip address: 7007`. Please try changing your files line endings. You may consider using a tool like [dos2unix](https://linux.die.net/man/1/dos2unix) for this purpose. Example command could be: `dos2unix ./Dojofile`.

We ran into this problem when using Dojo on WSL.

## Comparison to other tools

### vs. Batect

[Batect](https://github.com/charleskorn/batect) is the closest tool to Dojo and its created for the same reasons.
The primary differences between dojo and Batect:
 - Batect requires java to run, Dojo is a self-contained binary
 - Batect orchestrates multiple containers by itself, dojo uses docker-compose
 - Batect is configured with YAML where you define lifecycle tasks of the project. Dojo is agnostic towards the lifecycle, you can use any existing tool (Make, gradle, bash scripts) to define tasks/targets of the project.
 - Batect encourages usage of existing official images, therefore YAML config of each project has to define options such as volume mounts, users, etc. Dojo encourages having custom images, so that Dojofile config is minimal within a project.
 - Dojo does not support Windows.

### vs. Vagrant

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) has the same mission as Dojo - to make portable, easy to setup, development environments.
However vagrant is a tool from the *virtualization era* and is built around virtual machines. The typical workflow in vagrant is
```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
vagrant down
```
Major difference is that:
 * vagrant assumes a long running development environment, rather then spinning up new host for running each command. Dojo allows to have both approaches.
 * `vagrant up` can take time (VM booting time)
 * vagrant (in most cases) requires a periodic synchronization of your current working directory to the VM and back. In dojo, the filesystem is shared between the container and the host.

Still vagrant is a great tool and irreplaceable if you must use a VM.

`Dojofile` is similar to `Vagrantfile` in its function. But with a restriction that Dojo forces you to first build and release the image, while `Vagrantfile` has some tools to provision the VM when running `vagrant up` which adds up to the startup time.

### vs. dependency managers

A typical dependency manager allows you to commit references to all immediate and transitive dependencies in source control, files such as `Gemfile.lock`, `paket.lock`, `yarn.lock` etc. It is a good practice to do so, because project defines fully, in code, what libraries it depends on.
If we extend this concept, then we soon realize that the project did not define how the host, where it should be built, should look like. Probably, the most common situation is that there is a README file listing several tools to install. It does not provide a good developer experience.
In any sensible organization, configuration management is used to provision the CI-agents and developer's workstation building the project. It is one level better than the README, but still the definition of the environment exists outside the project and there is no reference to it.
The `Dojofile` is the *lock* file which allows to store this reference in source control. When you run `dojo <command>`, then the environment is fetched, just like a dependency manager would fetch all dependencies of the project.

## Contributing and Development

Instructions how to update this project.

1. Create a new feature branch from the `master` branch
2. Work on your changes in that feature branch. If you want, describe you changes in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
3. Compile the code and run tests locally, see the [2 options](#2-options-to-develop-Dojo) below
4. If you are happy with the results, create a PR from your feature branch to the main branch

After this, someone will read your PR, merge it and ensure version bump (using `./tasks set_version`). CI pipeline will run to automatically build and test docker image, release the project and publish the docker image.

### 2 options to develop Dojo
You may either use Dojo to develop Dojo, or use your local environment

You may take a look at the [CICD pipeline config](.circleci/config.yml) and at the [tasks](tasks) file. The tasks file has the same purpose as Makefile or Rakefile.

#### Option 1: Using Dojo to develop Dojo
1. Please ensure you have the [runtime dependencies](#dependencies) installed
2. Please install [Dojo](#installation)
3. Compile the code and run unit tests:
```
$ dojo -c Dojofile.build
./tasks _build
./tasks _unit
./tasks symlink linux
# or instead, if you're running on Mac: ./tasks symlink darwin
```

  or
  ```
  ./tasks build
  ./tasks unit

  ./tasks symlink linux
  # or instead, if you're running on Mac: ./tasks symlink darwin
  ```

4. Run end to end tests:
```
./tasks e2e ubuntu18
./tasks e2e alpine
```

#### Option 2: Using local environment to develop Dojo
1. Please ensure you have the [runtime dependencies](#dependencies) installed
2. Please install the development dependencies:
  * Golang
  * Python

3. Now you can compile and test Dojo:

  ```
  ./tasks _build
  ./tasks _unit

  ./tasks symlink linux
  # or instead, if you're running on Mac: ./tasks symlink darwin
  ./tasks _e2e
  ```
